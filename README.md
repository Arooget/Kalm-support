# Kalm Support

## This is the only official place for Kalm bug reports and feature requests.

1. Try disabling all Tweaks except Kalm in iCleaner to check if there is a conflicting tweak, if that does not help try removing the Kalm preferences file *hi.my.name.is.ubik.kalm.plist* in */var/mobile/Library/Preferences* and respring.

2. Please search for [already existing](https://github.com/himynameisubik/Kalm-support/issues) and [closed issues](https://github.com/himynameisubik/Kalm-support/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) before opening a new one.

3. If there is no issue with your request yet, [create a new issue here](https://github.com/himynameisubik/Kalm-support/issues/new/choose).
